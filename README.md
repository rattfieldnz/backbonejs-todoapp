# backbonejs-todoapp
Most of my time is spent working on back-end implementations. I thought I would better my front-end skills by working with the 'Todos' tutorial at https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals. I see BackBone as an excellent way of keeping front-end logic neatly organised, in the same MV* way I do in back-end work.

NOTE: I have included bower_components as per the StackOverflow answer at http://stackoverflow.com/a/22328067/678629.
